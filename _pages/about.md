😎 Hi, I am currently a third-year master student at Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University (PKU), supervised by [Prof. Meng Li](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1158/2309.htm). Pior to that, I received the B.S. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Fan Zhou](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/info/1035/9375.htm). My current research interests primarily focus on the **Efficient AI Algorithm & System, Agentic AI, Multimodal LLM, and LLM Reasoning.** From 2022, I have also explored a lot in the field of **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML)**, focusing on accelerating the private inference systems via protocol-algorithm co-optimization.

📝 Welcome to my [blog](https://xuanland.blog.csdn.net), where I keep recording my study notes and knowledge summaries about computer science from 2019 (😄 300+ blogs and 85w+ visits now!).

<!-- **🌟 <font color="red">Currently, I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for 2026 Fall. If you are interested in me, please contact me! -->

My EN and CN resumes are available here: [[EN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1olqLW8GYoEe4OQcmY0q6JCK3jhF7YogQ/view?usp=sharing)] [[CN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xTVt7H-9TvQRSBAIHhugVtbEfy-AGBZS/view?usp=sharing)] 😊 Kind tips: resumes may be outdated this time, but this homepage shows the latest information.
